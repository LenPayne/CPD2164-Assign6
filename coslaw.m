/* Create a new function that implements the cosine law. You will need to
 * use some of the math.h functions, like cos(x) and sqrt(x). Note that cos
 * accepts radians (not degrees) so all values will be given as radians.
 * 
 * The cosine law is used to find the length of the third side (C) of a
 * triangle, when you only know the length of two sides (A and B) and the 
 * angle between them (angle).
 *
 * In short: C = âˆš(A^2 + B^2 - 2*A*B*cos(angle))
